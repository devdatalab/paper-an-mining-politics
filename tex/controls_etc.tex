All regressions include state-year fixed effects and constituency
controls for the number of deposits within 10km of a constituency, a
constituency-level mineral dispersion index, and baseline (2001)
values of log constituency population, share of the population living
in rural areas, share of villages with electricity and the per
capita number of primary schools.  Standard errors are robust and
clustered at the district level.%
