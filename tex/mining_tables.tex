   \newline The table presents mean values for all variables used. The
   final two columns show coefficient and standard errors from a
   regression of the row variable on a forward-looking price shock
   (\textit{i.e.}, the shock that occurs \textit{after} the value is
   measured). The estimating equation is
   $Y_{c,d,s,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 *
   PriceShock_{c,d,s,t+1,t+6}+\gamma_{s,t} + \nu_{d}+\epsilon_{c,d,s,t}$,
   where $t$ is the first period where a given outcome can be observed.

  \newcommand{\tablenote}{The table estimates the impact of a local
    mineral price shock on the criminality of the local elected
    politician. \input{pshock_def} The dependent variable is an
    indicator that takes the value one if the local election winner is
    facing criminal charges. Column 1 estimates Equation~\ref{eq:main}
    on the full sample with state*year fixed effects. Columns 2 and 3
    respectively add district and constituency fixed effects. Sample
    size falls because constituency boundaries were redefined in 2007
    and there is only one observation per constituency for most
    predelimitation boundaries. Column 4 shows the marginal effect from
    a probit estimation of a similar specification to that in Column
    1. \input{controls_etc} }

    Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP); (2) an indicator that takes the value one if he/she is a
    member of the Indian National Congress (INC) party; (3) an

    The table estimates the impact of a local mineral price shock on
    the criminality of the local elected leader, focusing on specific
    types of crime. \input{pshock_def} In Column 1, the dependent
    variable is an indicator that takes the value one if the local
    election winner is facing charges for a violent crime, in which we
    include actual or attempted assault, armed robbery, homicide,
    kidnapping and sexual assault. In Column 2, we use an indicator
    that takes the value one if the election winner is charged with a
    non-violent crime, which is the set of crimes not used in
    Column 1. Column 3 estimates the impact on election winners being
    charged with corruption-related crimes (which include theft from
    government, manipulation of elections, and illegal influence over
    actions of public servants). Column 4 estimates the impact on
    election winners being charged with crimes other than those
    related to corruption. \input{controls_etc_dfe}} \small

\begin{table}[H]\caption{Effect of mineral price shocks on election competitiveness}
  \newcommand{\tablenote}{The table estimates the impact of a local
    mineral price shock on several indicators of electoral
    competitiveness. All columns estimate Equation~\ref{eq:main} at the
    constituency-election year level. \input{pshock_def} In Columns 1
    and 2, the dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value
    one if the local incumbent is re-elected. In Columns 3 and 4, the
    dependent variable is constituency level turnout. In Columns 5 and
    6, the dependent variable is the effective number of
    parties. Election data is available from 1990 to the
    present. Results are presented separately for elections for the full
    data from
    1990-2013 and from 2003-2013, a period comparable to other analyses

\begin{table}[H]\caption{Effect of mineral price shocks on candidate asset
    growth and criminal activity} \newcommand{\tablenote}{The table
    shows estimates of the impact of mineral wealth shocks on asset
    growth of elected leaders, and on new criminal charges against
    them.  The dependent variable in columns 1-3 is the change in a
    candidate's log net assets over a single electoral term. The price
    shock is the unanticipated change in mineral wealth in that
    electoral term, defined as the change in the global prices of the
    basket of mineral in each constituency, measured from the first
    year after the politician is elected to the end of the electoral
    term. Column 1 estimates the regression on elected officials
    only. In Column 2, the sample includes winners and runners up from
    the first election, and the price shock is interacted with a
    dummy variable indicating the election winner.  Column 3 is analogous to column 1, but adds an
    interaction with politicians' criminal status in the baseline
    period, to test whether politicians already facing charges
    systematically gain more assets in response to a positive mineral
    wealth shock. Columns 4 and 5 run specifications comparable to
    Columns 1 and 2, where the dependent variable is an indicator for
    whether the politician is facing more criminal charges at the end
    of the electoral term than at the beginning. \input{controls_etc}} \small
