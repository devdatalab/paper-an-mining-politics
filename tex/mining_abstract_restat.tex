We study how natural resource rents affect the selection and behavior
of holders of public office. Using global price shocks to thirty-one
minerals and nationwide geological and political data from India, we
show that local mineral rent shocks cause the election of politicians
charged with serious crimes.  We also find a moral hazard effect:
politicians commit more crimes and accumulate greater wealth when
mineral prices rise during their terms in office. These politicians
have direct influence over mining operations but no access to fiscal
windfalls from mining; we thus isolate the direct political impacts of
mining sector operations.
